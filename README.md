# socks-proxy-extension

Chromium extension to configure a localhost SOCKS proxy. Defaults to localhost:8080 but can be configured to use a different port.

## How do I install it?

I paid the $5 to put it up on the Chrome extension store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/socks-proxy/odiakldnmmpjabkemfboijigageaelcn

## How do I turn the proxy on / off?

Right click the little icon of a grey sock and check or un-check the "Use localhost SOCKS proxy" option. When the proxy is running a small green "on" badge will be overlaid on to the sock icon.

If the badge flashes red it means the browser isn't able to connect to the proxy for some reason.

## Reporting bugs

There will definitely be bugs. E-mail michael@hotplate.co.nz if you have any problems you'd like to report.
